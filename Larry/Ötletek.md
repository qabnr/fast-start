- Channels  <br>
    
- Min-max (zig-zag)     <br>
    with e.g. 5% price gap (or add as an input parameter)

- Trailing stop
    - A list of ATR TR stops    <br>
        with 'goodness' function, then choose the best

    - My on TR stop indicator   <br>
        to replace ATR TR stop to improve tending to the price line

- 2nd peak/valley improvement   <br>
    Looks quite good now, but might be improved

- Add 1st peak/valley   <br>
    might work as well?
